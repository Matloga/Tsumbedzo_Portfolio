## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#12181B) to provide a sophisticated and modern feel. This choice complements the original design's aesthetic and helps make content pop.
- Primary color: Coral-orange (#FF7F50) to serve as the main accent color, used sparingly for important interactive elements, links, and highlights. Inspired by the color on the original image.
- Accent color: Light desaturated gray (#B0B0B0) to provide subtle contrast and separation between elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. This will offer a clean, modern look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Responsive layout with clear sections for easy navigation.
- Simple line icons to represent skills and project categories.
